### About PI
I am Dr. **Yang (Gilbert) Ye**. I will be joining **Northeastern University** as an **Assistant Professor** in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in January 2025. I am a researcher and engineer in the field of human-robot interaction and robotics for resilient infrastructures in civil engineering. 
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Civil & Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida under the supervision of Dr. Eric Jing Du. My research focuses on automation and workforce engagement in civil engineering with advanced robotics, 
human-centric artificial intelligence, and human-robot interaction methods inspired by human sensorimotor processes. 
I  have published over 20 papers on top conferences and journals. I also serve as a reviewer in multiple journals such as Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 
Advanced Engineering Informatics, Computers in Human Behavior, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, and conferences. I am a member of ASCE, IEEE, and HFES.


### Research
Our research centers around automation, human-robot interaction, AI, and human-assistive technology in civil engineering environments. 
This cross-disciplinary journey has been and will be very interesting with exposures to cutting-edge technologies, 
including VR/AR, different morphs of robots (arm, hand, suit, quadrupedal, underwater, in-the-air), AI and machine learning, human physiological sensing... and more!

Ultimately, we wish to promote automation and reshape workforce in and beyond the civil engineering area with robots and human-centered AI. 

### Hiring
If this future excites you, **welcome to join**. We are recuiting **Ph.D. students** on rolling basis. Bachelors, masters, or visiting Ph.D. are also welcomed to work in our lab. 
Drop me an email at **gilbert.yangye@gmail.com** with your (1) CV, (2) cover letter, and (3) transcripts. 
Please highlight your qualifications and describe your motivation in your cover letter. 
A brief research statement (~ 1 page) stating a research problem of your choice and outlining your proposed approaches based on existing literature is recommended but not required.
