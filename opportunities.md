### About PI
I am Dr. **Yang (Gilbert) Ye**. I will be joining **Northeastern University** as an **Assistant Professor** in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in January 2025. I am a researcher and engineer in the field of human-robot interaction and robotics for resilient infrastructures in civil engineering. 
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Civil & Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida under the supervision of Dr. Eric Jing Du. My research focuses on automation and workforce engagement in civil engineering with advanced robotics, 
human-centric artificial intelligence, and human-robot interaction methods inspired by human sensorimotor processes. 
I  have published over 20 papers on top conferences and journals. I also serve as a reviewer in multiple journals such as Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 
Advanced Engineering Informatics, Computers in Human Behavior, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, and conferences. I am a member of ASCE, IEEE, and HFES.


### Research
Our research centers around automation, human-robot interaction, AI, and human-assistive technology in civil engineering environments. 
This cross-disciplinary journey has been and will be very interesting with exposures to cutting-edge technologies, 
including VR/AR, different morphs of robots (arm, hand, suit, quadrupedal, underwater, in-the-air), AI and machine learning, human physiological sensing... and more!

Ultimately, we wish to promote automation and reshape workforce in and beyond the civil engineering area with robots and human-centered AI. 


### Ph.D. Hiring
We are recuiting **Ph.D. students** on rolling basis. Please drop me an email at **gilbert.application@gmail.com** with your:
	(1) CV, including your GPA and preferably ranking as well as a summary of your past research experience and publications;
	(2) cover letter, highlight your qualifications and describe your motivation. 
	(3) transcripts.
A brief research statement (~ 1 page) stating a research problem of your choice and outlining your proposed approaches based on existing literature is recommended but not required.

Minimum requirements for PhD applicants:
	(1). GPA should be above 3.6/4.0 during both undergrad and master education. 
	(2). Have a background in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, industrial engineering, civil engineering, or other related fields. 
	(3). Have coding experience in one or more of the programming languages: Python, C++, C#. 
	(4). Be motivated about research and showcase excellent communication skills.
	(5). Fulfill the general requirements for doctoral admissions listed by Northeastern University (https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/graduate-school-of-engineering/graduate-admissions/).
Minimum requirements may be waived if you have demonstrated outstanding research potential/achievements, or if you are supported by fundings. 

See the poster below for details.

#### Research Opportunities for undergraduate/master students
If you are a current undergraduate/master student at Northeastern, you are very welcomed to reach out for research opportunites or thesis advisory. 
Please contact me at **gilbert.application@gmail.com** with your transcript and a short cover letter that briefly introduces your background, availability, and interests.

#### Post-doctoral researcher
If you are interested in postdoctoral opportunities, please e-mail me with the subject "Postdoc inquiry - in response to your website". Please explain how you could contribute to the group, describe your prior research, and plan for future research. Please also include your CV and google scholar (or equivalent) page.
If you do not provide these items, I am not able to respond to your e-mail. Interested scholars are encouraged to contact me and co-apply for postdoc fellowships (there are a lot of postdoc fellowship opportunities! See application guidance).

#### Funding
All Ph.D. students and postdocs are funded as long as they are making satisfactory progress. 
Funding includes all tuition, insurance, plus a stipend for living expenses. 
The good news is that Ph.D. students and postdocs can pursue their academic goals without a significant financial burden. 
The challenge is that your prospective advisor must secure adequate funding (over $250k for a Ph.D.) in order to make an admission offer. 
If you have external fellowship funding or are planning to apply for one, please make that clear in your application as it makes it SIGNIFICANTLY easier for an advisor to commit to admitting you. 
You are encouraged to explore possible external fundings (for both Ph.D. and Postdoc).
